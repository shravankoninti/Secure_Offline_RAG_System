# Multilingual Secure Offline RAG Chat Interface System

A Streamlit-based application that implements a multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for document querying and chat interactions. The system supports offline operation, multiple document formats, and bilingual responses (English and French).

## Features

### Core Features
- üîí **Secure offline operation**
- üìö **Support for multiple document formats** (PDF, CSV, TXT)
- üåç **Bilingual support** (English and French) - but the model is good enough to support other languages.
- üí¨ **Interactive chat interface**
- üìë **Document chunking and vector storage**
- üìä **PDF export of chat conversations**
- ü§ñ **Advanced language model integration**
- üîç **Semantic search capabilities**

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster processing)
- At least 16GB RAM recommended

## Installation

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python streamlit run app.py 
```

## Interface Guidelines

* Access the application through your web browser (typically http://localhost:8501)

### Using the Interface:
* 1. Upload documents using the sidebar
* 1.Select your preferred response language (English/French)
* 1.Click "Process Documents" to index your uploaded files
* 1.Start chatting with the system about your documents
* 1.Download chat history as PDF when needed


## Document Support

### Supported Formats
* PDF files (.pdf)
* CSV files (.csv)
* Text files (.txt)


## System Architecture

### MultilingualRAGSystem Class

The main class that handles:

* Document processing and embedding
* Vector store management
* Language model interactions
* Chat response generation
* PDF export functionality


## Key Methods
- `initialize_models()` : Sets up embedding and language models
- `load_documents()` : Handles document upload and processing
- `process_documents()` : Creates document chunks and vector store
- `get_response()` : Generates responses based on user queries
- `create_pdf()` : Exports chat history to PDF

## Technical Components

### Language Models

* `Embedding Model` : sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2
* `Language Model`: Language Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct
* `Vector Store` : Vector Store: FAISS for efficient similarity search


## Performance Considerations

* First-time initialization may take a few minutes as models are loaded
* Document processing time depends on file size and number of documents
* GPU acceleration is automatically used if available


## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling and logging:

* Document processing errors
* Model initialization issues
* Runtime exceptions
* PDF generation errors


## Open Source Components

### Language Models and Embeddings

* Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct: Apache 2.0 License
* Sentence Transformers (paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2): Apache 2.0 License
